What to do?
Adopt his coding style? Stop joking : _the man is british_.
Edit every single file? There is hundreds of them! By the time you finish, he'll have released 5 new versions and you'll have to start over!

**NO!**
Cry no more because here is Plucked! Plucked will edit any *yymps* package and automatically disable Feather on every script file in a single action!
